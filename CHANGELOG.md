## 0.7.0 - February 14, 2017
This release has focused on improving the "getting started" experience by adding an `Add-PoshGitToProfile` command that
modifies the user's PowerShell profile script to import the posh-git module whenever PowerShell starts.
When posh-git is imported, it will automatically install a posh-git prompt that displays Git status summary information.
Work was also done to improve performance of `Get-GitStatus` when inside large Git repositories.
Work was begun to eliminate some obvious crashes on PowerShell on .NET Core but more work remains to be done.
