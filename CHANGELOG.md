# posh-git Release History

## 1.0.0 - March 10, 2021

- Released to PowerShell Gallery.
- Fate of Chocolatey to be determined.

## 1.0.0-beta5 - February 14, 2021

### Added

- Added --renormalize to the "git add" parameters for tab-completion.
  ([PR #791](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/791))
  Thanks @dannoe
- Pass PowerShell aliases down to posh-git TabExpansion autocomplete function
  ([#257](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/issues/257))

  Thanks @csc027

  Thanks @rdnlsmith

  ([PR #822](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/822))
  Thanks @breisfeld Brad Reisfeld

### Changed

- `$GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptAbbreviateHomeDirectory` defaults to `$false` on Windows. When enabled, `~` is
   always substituted for the user's home path. Before this change, when directly in your home dir, this setting would
   result in the full path displayed in the prompt e.g. `C:\Users\Keith`.  After this change, `~` will be displayed.
   The new behavior is consistent with how the home path is displayed in prompts in other shells on Linux.
  ([#746](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/746))
  ([PR #801](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/801))

  ([PR #678](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/678))
  ([PR #705](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/705))
- `$global:GitPromptValues` with the following properties to enable users to have access to the information necessary

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/684))

  - `LogPath` - the path to the log file that is appended to (created if necessary) when `EnableLogging` is `$true`.

### Changed

- Module parameter changed from a [switch] that forced the posh-git prompt to be used to a bools. The use of this
  parameters during import is now simplified to: `Import-Module posh-git -Args 1`.
- Shortened up the Windows title text to work better with Windows Terminal tabs. Now only displays '32-bit' in 32-bit
  PowerShell, otherwise assumption is you're running 64-bit. Also display only PowerShell major.minor version number.
  ([PR #707](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/707))
- Switched from overriding `TabExpansion` function to using `Register-ArgumentCompleter` for tab-completion on
  PowerShell >= 6.0.  `posh-git` can be configured to use the old `TabExpansion` function on PowerShell >= 6.0 by
  importing the module using the following arguments: `Import-Module posh-git -ArgumentList 0,1`
  before importing `posh-git`.

  ([PR #677](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/677))
  Thanks @ExE-Boss
- `$GitPromptSettings.BeforeIndex` is always displayed even if there is nothing in the index.  The intent of
  this separator setting is to provide a separator between the branch name / branch status and the following section of
  index/working/summary/stash indicators.
  ([PR #723](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/723))
- posh-git no longers sets missing `HOME` environment variable.
  ([#718](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/issues/718))

  ([PR #616](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/616))

## 1.0.0-beta2 - May 13, 2018

The 1.0.0 release is targeted specifically at Windows PowerShell 5.x and (cross-platform) PowerShell Core 6.x, both of
which support classes, enabling the enhanced structure of `$GitPromptSettings`,
and writing prompt strings using [ANSI escape sequences][ansi-esc-code] /
[Console Virtual Terminal Sequences][console-vt-seq] (supported since Windows 10 version 1511).

Consequently, this release introduces BREAKING changes with 0.x.
If you are still on Windows PowerShell 2.0, 3.0 or 4.0, please continue to use the 0.x version of posh-git.

### Changed

- Renamed `$GitPromptSettings` values
  - `BeforeText` to `BeforeStatus`
  - `DelimText` to `DelimStatus`
  - `AfterText` to `AfterStatus`
  - `BeforeIndexText` to `BeforeIndex`
  - `BeforeStashText` to `BeforeStash`
  - `AfterStashText` to `AfterStash`
- Split `$GirPromptSettings.DefaultPromptSuffix` and `$GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptDebugSuffix` into:
  1. `DefaultPromptBeforeSuffix` (`''`)
  2. `DefaultPromptDebug` (`' [DBG]:'`), which is rendered if a debugger is attached
  3. `DefaultPromptSuffix` (`'$(">" * ($nestedPromptLevel + 1)) '`), which is rendered last
     (or returned from `prompt`, for terminals that don't support escape sequences)
- Renamed `$GitPromptSettings.EnableWindowTitle` to `$GitPromptSettings.WindowTitle` with significant improvements:
  - `$Host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle` is now set on every `prompt`, not just when inside a Git repo.
  - To prevent setting `WindowTitle`, set `$GitPromptSettigs.WindowTitle` to `$null`.
  - The `WindowTitle` update has been moved from the `Write-GitStatus` command to the built-in `prompt` function.
  - `$GitPromptSettings.WindowTitle` is now fully customizable:
    - As a `string`, it will be processed with [`ExpandString`][invokecommand-expandstring].
    - As a `ScriptBlock` (default), it will be executed with two parameters: `$GitStatus` and `$IsAdmin`.
- When a color setting is specified by a `string` (color name), it is parsed as an HTML color
  (on platforms that support `System.Drawing.ColorTranslator`) before being parsed as a `ConsoleColor`.
  To force using `ConsoleColors`, use static member syntax (e.g. `[ConsoleColor]::Cyan`).
  ([PR #536](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/536))
- `PoshGitVcsPrompt` errors now show details if `$GitPromptSettings.Debug`
  ([PR #560](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/560))

### Added

- New command `Get-PromptPath` which formats the path displayed in the prompt and window title.
  This command honors `$GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptAbbreviateHomeDirectory`.
  - A path exactly matching `$HOME` is now shown in full, rather than abbreviated to `~`
    ([PR #567](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/567))
- New `$GitPromptSettings` values (default):
  - `PathStatusSeparator` (` `)
  - `DefaultPromptPath` (`'$(Get-PromptPath)'`)
  - `DefaultPromptWriteStatusFirst` (`$false`)
  - `DefaultPromptTimingFormat` (`' {0}ms'`)
- `RepoName` property has been addded to the `$global:GitStatus` object returned by `Get-GitStatus`.
- Added `$GitPromptSettings.UntrackedFilesMode`;
  accepted values are `$null` (inherit `status.showUntrackedFiles`), "all", "no", and "normal"
  ([#556](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/556))
  ([PR #557](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/557))
  Thanks David Snedecor (@TheSned)
- Exported `Expand-GitCommand` for use with custom tab expansion
  ([#562](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/562))
  ([PR #563](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/563))

### Fixed

- Fixed `$GitPromptSettings.EnablePromptStatus` should not affect `Get-GitStatus` by adding `-Force` parameter.
  ([#475](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/issues/475))
  ([PR #535](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/535))
- Fixed PowerShell Core bug where we were using `Get-Content -Encoding Byte` when processing profile scripts during
  Chocolatey install/uninstall. That encoding doesn't exist in PowerShell Core.
  Switched to `Get-Content -AsByteStream` on PowerShell Core.
  ([PR #532](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/532))
- Fixed ANSI rendering bug: when both `ForegroundColor` and `BackgroundColor` colors are `$null` (default),
  we were emitting an unnecessary terminating escape sequence `"$([char]27)[0m"`.
  ([PR #532](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/532))
- Fixed issue where setting `ForegroundColor` or `BackgroundColor` to 0 (Black) rendered the default color instead.
- Updated Git subcommand lists
  ([#561](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/issues/561))
  ([PR #571](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/571))

## 1.0.0-beta1 - January 10, 2018

### Removed

- Drop support for PowerShell 2.0
  ([#163](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/issues/163))
  ([PR #427](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/427))
- Drop support for PowerShell 3.0 and 4.0
  ([#328](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/issues/328))
  ([PR #513](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/513))
- Remove public `Enable-GitColors`, `Get-AliasPattern`, `Get-GitBranch` and `Invoke-NullCoalescing` and its `??` alias
  ([#93](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/issues/93))
  ([PR #427](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/427))

### Changed

- Changed the `$GitPromptSettings` hashtable to a stongly typed object.
  Here is one example of the impact of this change:

  ```powershell
  $GitPromptSettings.LocalWorkingStatusSymbol = '#'
  $GitPromptSettings.LocalWorkingStatusForegroundColor = [ConsoleColor]::DarkRed
  ```

  Changes to:

  ```powershell
  $GitPromptSettings.LocalWorkingStatusSymbol.Text = '#'
  $GitPromptSettings.LocalWorkingStatusSymbol.ForegroundColor = [ConsoleColor]::DarkRed
  ```

- Changed `Write-VcsStatus`, `Write-GitStatus` and `Write-Prompt` to return a string rather than write to host when
  the host supports ANSI escape sequences.

### Added

- Implement support for ANSI escape sequences for colored output - support System.ConsoleColor, System.Drawing.HtmlColor
  (if available on the platform) and 24-bit color.  NOTE: this is a breaking change since `Write-VcsStatus`,
  `Write-GitStatus` and `Write-Prompt` will now return a string rather than write to the host when the host supports
  ANSI escape sequences.
  ([#304](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/304))
  ([#447](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/447))
  ([#455](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/455))
- $GitPromptSettings is now a strongly typed object using PS classes
  ([#344](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/issues/344))
  ([PR #513](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/513))
- Provide more granular commands than just `Write-GitStatus`.
  ([#345](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/issues/345))
  ([PR #513](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/513))
  We now export the commands that `Write-GitStatus` uses internally which are:
  - Write-GitBranchName
  - Write-GitBranchStatus
  - Write-GitIndexStatus
  - Write-GitStashCount
  - Write-GitWorkingDirStatus
  - Write-GitWorkingDirStatusSummary

### Fixed

- Fixed Get-AuthenticodeSignature not on PS Core.
  ([PR #487](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/487))
- Provide DefaultPromptPrefixColor and DefaultPromptSuffixColor options
  ([#474](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/issues/474))

  ([#282](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/issues/282))
  ([PR #447](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/447))

## 0.7.3 - April 19, 2018

- posh-git now exports the variable `$GitPromptScriptBlock` which contains the code for the default prompt.
  ([#501](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/issues/501))
  ([PR #513](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/pull/513))

  If you need to execute your own logic in your own prompt function but still want to display the default posh-git
  prompt, you can execute this scriptblock from your prompt function e.g.:

  ```powershell
  # profile.ps1
  function prompt {
    Set-NodeVersion
    &$GitPromptScriptBlock
  }
  Import-Module posh-git
  ```

## 0.7.0 - February 14, 2017

This release has focused on improving the "getting started" experience by adding an `Add-PoshGitToProfile` command that
modifies the user's PowerShell profile script to import the posh-git module whenever PowerShell starts.
When posh-git is imported, it will automatically install a posh-git prompt that displays Git status summary information.
Work was also done to improve performance of `Get-GitStatus` when inside large Git repositories.
Work was begun to eliminate some obvious crashes on PowerShell on .NET Core but more work remains to be done.
