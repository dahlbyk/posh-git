## Overview

posh-git is a PowerShell module that integrates Git and PowerShell by providing Git status summary information that
can be displayed in the PowerShell prompt, e.g.:

![C:\Users\Keith\GitHub\posh-git [main ≡ +0 ~1 -0 | +0 ~1 -0 !]> ][prompt-def-long]

posh-git also provides tab completion support for common git commands, branch names, paths and more.
For example, with posh-git, PowerShell can tab complete git commands like `checkout` by typing `git ch` and pressing
the <kbd>tab</kbd> key. That will tab complete to `git checkout` and if you keep pressing <kbd>tab</kbd>, it will
cycle through other command matches such as `cherry` and `cherry-pick`. You can also tab complete remote names and
branch names e.g.: `git pull or<tab> ma<tab>` tab completes to `git pull origin main`.

## Installation

These installation instructions, as well as rest of this readme, applies only to version 1.x of posh-git.
For v0.x installation instructions see this [README][v0-readme].

### Prerequisites

Before installing posh-git make sure the following prerequisites have been met.

1. Windows PowerShell 5.x or PowerShell Core 6.0.
   You can get PowerShell Core 6.0 for Windows, Linux or macOS from [here][pscore-install].
   Check your PowerShell version by executing `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`.

2. On Windows, script execution policy must be set to either `RemoteSigned` or `Unrestricted`.
   Check the script execution policy setting by executing `Get-ExecutionPolicy`.
   If the policy is not set to one of the two required values, run PowerShell as Administrator and
   execute `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Confirm`.

3. Git must be installed and available via the PATH environment variable.
   Check that `git` is accessible from PowerShell by executing `git --version` from PowerShell.
   If `git` is not recognized as the name of a command, verify that you have Git installed.
   If not, install Git from [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).
   If you have Git installed, make sure the path to git is in your PATH environment variable.

### Installing posh-git via PowerShellGet on Linux, macOS and Windows

posh-git is available on the [PowerShell Gallery][psgallery-v1] and can be installed using the built-in PowerShellGet module.

1. Start Windows PowerShell 5.x or PowerShell >= v6 (`pwsh`).

2. Execute one of the following two commands from an elevated PowerShell prompt,
   depending on whether (A) you've never installed posh-git, or (B) you've already installed a previous version:

    ```powershell
    # (A) You've never installed posh-git from the PowerShell Gallery
    PowerShellGet\Install-Module posh-git -Scope CurrentUser -Force
    ```

    > **NOTE**: If you're asked to trust packages from the PowerShell Gallery, answer `yes` to continue installation of posh-git

    OR

    ```powershell
    # (B) You've already installed a previous version of posh-git from the PowerShell Gallery
    PowerShellGet\Update-Module posh-git
    ```

### Installing posh-git via Chocolatey

If you prefer to manage posh-git as a Windows package, you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) to install posh-git.
If you don't have Chocolatey, you can install it from the [Chocolately Install page](https://chocolatey.org/install).
With Chocolatey installed, execute the following command to install posh-git:

```powershell
choco install poshgit
```

### Installing posh-git via Scoop

Another popular package manager for Windows is [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), which you can also use
 to install posh-git. With Scoop installed, execute these commands to install posh-git and import
 it into your profile:

```powershell
scoop install posh-git
Add-PoshGitToProfile
```

### Installing posh-git Manually

If you need to test/debug changes prior to contributing here, or would otherwise prefer to install posh-git without
the aid of a package manager, you can execute `Import-Module <path-to-src\posh-git.psd1>`.  For example, if you
have git cloned posh-git to `~\git\posh-git` you can import this version of posh-git by executing
`Import-Module ~\git\posh-git\src\posh-git.psd1`.

## Using posh-git

After you have installed posh-git, you need to configure your PowerShell session to use the posh-git module.

### Step 1: Import posh-git

The first step is to import the module into your PowerShell session which will enable git tab completion.
You can do this with the command `Import-Module posh-git`.

### Step 2: Import posh-git from your PowerShell profile

You do not want to have to manually execute the `Import-Module` command every time you open a new PowerShell prompt.
Let's have PowerShell import this module for you in each new PowerShell session.
We can do this by either executing the command `Add-PoshGitToProfile` or by editing your PowerShell profile script and
adding the command `Import-Module posh-git`.

If you want posh-git to be available in all your PowerShell hosts (console, ISE, etc) then execute
`Add-PoshGitToProfile -AllHosts`. This will add a line containing `Import-Module posh-git` to the file
`$profile.CurrentUserAllHosts`.

If you want posh-git to be available in just the current host, then execute `Add-PoshGitToProfile`.
This will add the same command but to the file `$profile.CurrentUserCurrentHost`.

If you want posh-git to be available for all users on the system, start PowerShell as Administrator or
via sudo (`sudo pwsh`) on Linux/macOS then execute `Add-PoshGitToProfile -AllUsers -AllHosts`.
This will add the import command to `$profile.AllUsersAllHosts`.

If you want to configure posh-git for all users but only for the current host,
drop the `-AllHosts` parameter and the command will modify `$profile.AllUsersCurrentHost`.

If you'd prefer, you can manually edit the desired PowerShell profile script.
Open (or create) your profile script with the command `notepad $profile.CurrentUserAllHosts`.
In the profile script, add the following line:

```powershell
Import-Module posh-git
```

Save the profile script, then close PowerShell and open a new PowerShell session.
Type `git fe` and then press <kbd>tab</kbd>. If posh-git has been imported, that command should tab complete to
`git fetch`.

If you want posh-git to detect your own aliases for git, then you *must* have set the alias *before* importing posh-git.
So if you have `Set-Alias g git` then ensure it is executed before `Import-Module posh-git`, and `g checkout` will
complete as if you'd typed `git`.

## Git status summary information

The Git status summary information provides a wealth of "Git status" information at a glance, all the time in your
prompt.

By default, the status summary has the following format:

    [{HEAD-name} S +A ~B -C !D | +E ~F -G !H W]

- `[` (`BeforeStatus`)
- `{HEAD-name}` is the current branch, or the SHA of a detached HEAD
  - Cyan means the branch matches its remote
  - Green means the branch is ahead of its remote (green light to push)
  - Red means the branch is behind its remote
  - Yellow means the branch is both ahead of and behind its remote
- `S` represents the branch status in relation to remote (tracked origin) branch.

  Note: This status information reflects the state of the remote tracked branch after the last `git fetch/pull`
  of the remote. Execute `git fetch` to update to the latest on the default remote repo. If you have multiple remotes,
  execute `git fetch --all`.

  - `≡` = The local branch in at the same commit level as the remote branch (`BranchIdenticalStatus`)
  - `↑<num>` = The local branch is ahead of the remote branch by the specified number of commits; a `git push` is
    required to update the remote branch (`BranchAheadStatus`)
  - `↓<num>` = The local branch is behind the remote branch by the specified number of commits; a `git pull` is
    required to update the local branch (`BranchBehindStatus`)
  - `<a>↕<b>` = The local branch is both ahead of the remote branch by the specified number of commits (a) and behind
    by the specified number of commits (b); a rebase of the local branch is required before pushing local changes to
    the remote branch (`BranchBehindAndAheadStatus`).  NOTE: this status is only available if
    `$GitPromptSettings.BranchBehindAndAheadDisplay` is set to `Compact`.
  - `×` = The local branch is tracking a branch that is gone from the remote (`BranchGoneStatus`)
- `ABCD` represent the index; `|` (`DelimStatus`); `EFGH` represent the working directory
  - `+` = Added files
  - `~` = Modified files
  - `-` = Removed files
  - `!` = Conflicted files
  - As with `git status` output, index status is displayed in dark green and working directory status in dark red

- `W` represents the overall status of the working directory
  - `!` = There are unstaged changes in the working tree (`LocalWorkingStatusSymbol`)
  - `~` = There are uncommitted changes i.e. staged changes in the working tree waiting to be committed (`LocalStagedStatusSymbol`)
  - None = There are no unstaged or uncommitted changes to the working tree (`LocalDefaultStatusSymbol`)
- `]` (`AfterStatus`)

The symbols and surrounding text can be customized by the corresponding properties on `$GitPromptSettings`.

For example, a status of `[main ≡ +0 ~2 -1 | +1 ~1 -0]` corresponds to the following `git status`:

```powershell
# On branch main
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#        modified:   this-changed.txt
#        modified:   this-too.txt
#        deleted:    gone.ps1
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#        modified:   not-staged.ps1
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#        new.file
```

## Customization variables

posh-git adds variables to your session to let you customize it, including `$GitPromptSettings`, `$GitTabSettings`, and
`$TortoiseGitSettings`. For an example of how to configure your PowerShell profile script to import the posh-git
module and create a custom prompt function that displays git status info, see the
[Customizing Your PowerShell Prompt](#customizing-the-posh-git-prompt) section below.

Note on performance: Displaying file status in the git prompt for a very large repo can be prohibitively slow.
Rather than turn off file status entirely (`$GitPromptSettings.EnableFileStatus = $false`), you can disable it on a
repo-by-repo basis by adding individual repository paths to `$GitPromptSettings.RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus`.

## Customizing the posh-git prompt

When you import the posh-git module, it will replace PowerShell's default prompt function with a new prompt function.
The posh-git prompt function will display Git status summary information when the current directory is inside a Git
repository. posh-git will not replace the prompt function if it has detected that you have your own, customized prompt
function.

The prompt function provided by posh-git creates a prompt that looks like this:

![~\GitHub\posh-git [main ≡]> ][prompt-default]

You can customize the posh-git prompt function or define your own custom prompt function.
The rest of this section covers how to customize posh-git's prompt function using the global variable
`$GitPromptSettings`.

**If you'd like to make any of following changes permanent, i.e. available whenever you start PowerShell, put the
corresponding setting(s) in one of your profile scripts after the line that imports posh-git.**

For instance, you can customize the default prompt prefix to display a colored timestamp with these settings:

```text
$GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptPrefix.Text = '$(Get-Date -f "MM-dd HH:mm:ss") '
$GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptPrefix.ForegroundColor = [ConsoleColor]::Magenta
```

This will change the prompt to:

![02-18 13:45:19 ~\GitHub\posh-git [main ≡]> ][prompt-prefix]

If you would prefer not to have any path under your home directory abbreviated with `~`, use the following setting:

```text
$GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptAbbreviateHomeDirectory = $false
```

This will change the prompt to:

![C:\Users\Keith\GitHub\posh-git [main ≡]> ][prompt-no-abbr]

If you would like to change the color of the path, you can use the following setting on Windows:

```text
$GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptPath.ForegroundColor = 'Orange'
```

> Note: Setting the ForegroundColor to a color name, other than one of the standard ConsoleColor names, only works on Windows.
On Windows, posh-git uses the `[System.Drawing.ColorTranslator]::FromHtml(string colorName)` method to parse a color
name as an HTML color. For a complete list of HTML colors, see this [W3Schools page][w3c-colors].

If you are on Linux or macOS and desire an Orange path, you will need to specify the RGB value for Orange e.g.:

```text
$GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptPath.ForegroundColor = 0xFFA500
```

This will change the prompt to:

![~\GitHub\posh-git [main]> ][prompt-path]

If you would like to make your prompt span two lines, with a newline after the Git status summary, use this setting:

```text
$GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptBeforeSuffix.Text = '`n'
```

This will change the prompt to:

![~\GitHub\posh-git [main ≡]&#10;> ][prompt-two-line]

You can swap the order of the path and the Git status summary with the following setting:

```text
$GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptWriteStatusFirst = $true
```

This will change the prompt to:

![[main ≡] ~\GitHub\posh-git> ][prompt-swap]

Finally, you can combine these settings to customize the posh-git prompt fairly significantly.
In the `DefaultPromptSuffix` field below, we are prepending the PowerShell history id number before the prompt
char `>` e.g.:

```text
$GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptWriteStatusFirst = $true
$GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptBeforeSuffix.Text = '`n$([DateTime]::now.ToString("MM-dd HH:mm:ss"))'
$GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptBeforeSuffix.ForegroundColor = 0x808080
$GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptSuffix = ' $((Get-History -Count 1).id + 1)$(">" * ($nestedPromptLevel + 1)) '
```

This will change the prompt to:

![[main ≡] ~\GitHub\posh-git&#10;02-18 14:04:35 38> ][prompt-custom]

Finally, the path portion of the prompt can be contained within delimiters.
For instance, if you would like the containing characters to be red, curly braces, the following settings can be used:

```powershell
$GitPromptSettings.BeforePath = '{'
$GitPromptSettings.AfterPath = '}'
$GitPromptSettings.BeforePath.ForegroundColor = 'Red'
$GitPromptSettings.AfterPath.ForegroundColor = 'Red'
```

With these additional values, the previous prompt would become

![[main ≡] {~\GitHub\posh-git}&#10;02-18 14:04:35 38> ][prompt-custom-wpathdelim]

### Prompt Layouts

For reference, the following layouts show the relative position of the various parts of the posh-git prompt.
Note that `<>` denotes parts of the prompt that may not appear depending on the status of settings and whether or not
the current dir is in a Git repository.
To simplify the layout, `DP` is being used as an abbreviation for `DefaultPrompt` settings.

Default prompt layout:

```text
{DPPrefix}{BeforePath}{DPPath}{AfterPath}{PathStatusSeparator}<{BeforeStatus}{Status}{AfterStatus}>{DPBeforeSuffix}<{DPDebug}><{DPTimingFormat}>{DPSuffix}
```

Prompt layout when DefaultPromptWriteStatusFirst is set to $true:

```text
{DPPrefix}<{BeforeStatus}{Status}{AfterStatus}>{PathStatusSeparator}{BeforePath}{DPPath}{AfterPath}{DPBeforeSuffix}<{DPDebug}><{DPTimingFormat}>{DPSuffix}
```

### Displaying Error Information

If you want to display the error status of the last command, you can use the values stored in the `$global:GitPromptValues`
object which includes the value of `$LastExitCode` and `$?` (represented by the property `DollarQuestion`). Here is
a prompt customization that displays a Red exit code value when `$LastExitCode` is non-zero or a Red `!` if `$?`
is `$false`:

```powershell
function global:PromptWriteErrorInfo() {
    if ($global:GitPromptValues.DollarQuestion) { return }

    if ($global:GitPromptValues.LastExitCode) {
        "`e[31m(" + $global:GitPromptValues.LastExitCode + ") `e[0m"
    }
    else {
        "`e[31m! `e[0m"
    }
}

$global:GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptBeforeSuffix.Text = '`n$(PromptWriteErrorInfo)$([DateTime]::now.ToString("MM-dd HH:mm:ss"))'
```

When a PowerShell command fails, this is the prompt you will see:

![~\GitHub\posh-git [main ≡]&#10;! 07-01 22:36:31> ][prompt-error1]

When an external application returns a non-zero exit code, 1 in this case, you will see the exit code in the prompt:

![~\GitHub\posh-git [main ≡]&#10;(1) 07-01 22:32:28> ][prompt-error2]

Note that until you run an external application that sets `$LASTEXITCODE` to zero or you manually set the variable to
0, you will see the exit code for any error.  In addition to `LastExitCode` and `DollarQuestion`,
`$global:GitPromptValues` also has `IsAdmin` and `LastPrompt` properties.  The `LastPrompt` property contains the ANSI
escaped string that was used for the last prompt. This can be useful for debugging your prompt display particularly
when using ANSI/VT sequences.

### $GitPromptScriptBlock

If you require even more customization than `$GitPromptSettings` provides, you can create your own prompt
function to show whatever information you want.
See the [Customizing Your PowerShell Prompt][wiki-custom-prompt] wiki page for details.

However, if you need a custom prompt just to perform some non-prompt logic, you can still use posh-git's
prompt function to write out the prompt string.  This can be done with the `$GitPromptScriptBlock` variable as shown
below e.g.:

```powershell
# my profile.ps1
function prompt {
    # Your non-prompt logic here

    # Have posh-git display its default prompt
    & $GitPromptScriptBlock
}
```

And if you'd like to write prompt text before and/or after the posh-git prompt,
you can use posh-git's `Write-Prompt` command as shown below:

```powershell
# my profile.ps1
function prompt {
    # Your non-prompt logic here
    $prompt = Write-Prompt "Text before posh-git prompt " -ForegroundColor ([ConsoleColor]::Green)
    $prompt += & $GitPromptScriptBlock
    $prompt += Write-Prompt "Text after posh-git prompt" -ForegroundColor ([ConsoleColor]::Magenta)
    if ($prompt) { "$prompt " } else { " " }
}
```
