posh-hg
========

**This project is no longer under development and is not maintained. Please feel free to use the code, but no changes will be made and no pull requests will be merged in.** 

Inspired by the Posh-Git project (http://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git), Posh-Hg provides a set of PowerShell scripts which provide Mercurial/PowerShell integration

### Prompt for Hg repositories
   The prompt within Hg repositories can show the current branch and the state of files (additions, modifications, deletions) within.
   
### Tab completion
   Provides tab completion for common commands when using hg.  
   E.g. `hg up<tab>` --> `hg update`
   
Usage
-----

See `profile.example.ps1` as to how you can integrate the tab completion and/or hg prompt into your own profile.
Prompt formatting, among other things, can be customized using the `$PoshHgSettings` variable. 

Installing
----------

0. Verify you have PowerShell 2.0 or better with $PSVersionTable.PSVersion

1. Verify execution of scripts is allowed with `Get-ExecutionPolicy` (should be `RemoteSigned` or `Unrestricted`). If scripts are not enabled, run PowerShell as Administrator and call `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Confirm`.

2. Verify that `hg` can be run from PowerShell. If the command is not found, you will need to add a hg alias or add `%ProgramFiles%\TortoiseHg` to your PATH environment variable.

3. Clone the posh-hg repository to your local machine.

4. From the posh-hg repository directory, run `.\install.ps1`.

5. Enjoy!

The Prompt
----------

PowerShell generates its prompt by executing a `prompt` function, if one exists. posh-hg defines such a function in `profile.example.ps1` that outputs the current working directory followed by an abbreviated `hg status`:

    C:\Users\JSkinner [default]>

By default, the status summary has the following format:

    [{HEAD-name} +A ~B -C ?D !E ^F <G:H>]

* `{HEAD-name}` is the current branch, or the SHA of a detached HEAD
 * Cyan means the branch matches its remote
 * Red means the branch is behind its remote
* ABCDEFGH represent the working directory
 * `+` = Added files
 * `~` = Modified files
 * `-` = Removed files
 * `?` = Untracked files
 * `!` = Missing files
 * `^` = Renamed files
 * `<G:H>` = Current revision information matching the output of `hg log -r . --template '{rev}:{node|short}'`

Additionally, Posh-Hg can show any tags and bookmarks in the prompt as well as MQ patches if the MQ extension is enabled (disabled by default)
