    posh-git

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    posh-git integrates Git and PowerShell providing tab completion of Git
    commands, branch names, paths and more. It also provides Git status
    summary information that can be displayed in the PowerShell prompt.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    posh-git integrates Git and PowerShell. Tab completion is supported for
    Git subcommands, branch and remote names. Git also provides commands to
    display colored Git status summary information.  If you would like fine
    grained control over how the Git status summary information is displayed
    in your prompt function, you can get the raw status summary information
    via the Get-GitStatus command. Then you can display the information in
    your prompt however you would like.

    posh-git will install a prompt function if it detects the user does not
    have their own, customized prompt. This prompt displays Git status summary
    information when the current directory is located in a Git repository.

GIT TAB COMPLETION
    You can tab complete most common Git subcommands e.g.:

    C:\GitHub\posh-git> git ch<tab> --> git checkout

    You can also tab complete branch names and even remote names such as
    origin and upstream. For instance, type the following inside of a Git
    repo to see tab completion in action:

    C:\GitHub\posh-git> git fe<tab> or<tab> ma<tab>

    The above will expand to:

    C:\GitHub\posh-git> git fetch origin master

    And like tab completion in other parts of PowerShell, you can press tab
    multiple times to cycle through all matches.  For instance, type
    "git ch" and press the tab key multiple times to cycle through "checkout",
    "cherry" and "cherry-pick".

POWERSHELL PROMPT
    PowerShell generates its prompt by executing a function named "prompt", if
    one exists. posh-git will install its prompt function if it detects the
    user does not have their own, customized prompt function. This prompt
    displays the current working directory followed by git status summary
    information if the current directory is located in a Git repository, e.g.:

    C:\GitHub\posh-git [master ≡]>

    You can customize the posh-git prompt with the following settings:

    $GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptPrefix
    $GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptSuffix
    $GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptDebugSuffix
    $GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptEnableTiming
    $GitPromptSettings.DefaultPromptAbbreviateHomeDirectory

    own custom PowerShell prompt see:

GIT STATUS SUMMARY
    [{HEAD-name} S +A ~B -C !D | +E ~F -G !H W]

    * [ (BeforeText)
      * {HEAD-name} is the current branch, or the SHA of a detached HEAD
        * Cyan means the branch matches its remote
        * Green means the branch is ahead of its remote (green light to push)
        * Red means the branch is behind its remote
        * Yellow means the branch is both ahead of and behind its remote

      * S represents the branch status in relation to remote (tracked origin) branch
        * ≡      = Local branch is at the same commit level as the remote
                   branch (BranchIdenticalStatus).
        * ↑<num> = Local branch is ahead of the remote branch by the specified
                   number of commits; a 'git push' is required to update the
                   remote branch (BranchAheadStatus).
        * ↓<num> = Local branch is behind the remote branch by the specified
                   number of commits; a 'git pull' is required to update the
                   local branch (BranchBehindStatus).
        * <a>↕<b>= Local branch is both ahead of the remote branch by the
                   specified number of commits (<a>) and behind by the
                   specified number of commits (<b>); a rebase of the local
                   branch is required before pushing local changes to the
                   remote branch (BranchBehindAndAheadStatus). NOTE: this
                   status is only available if
                   $GitPromptSettings.BranchBehindAndAheadDisplay is set to
                   'Compact'.
        * × =      The local branch is tracking a branch that is gone from the
                   remote (BranchGoneStatus).

      * ABCD represents the index | EFGH represents the working directory
        * + = Added files
        * ~ = Modified files
        * - = Removed files
        * ! = Conflicted files
        * Index status is dark green and working directory status is dark red
          reflecting the colors used by 'git status'.

      * W represents the overall status of the working directory
        * ! = There are unstaged changes (LocalWorkingStatus)
        * ~ = There are uncommitted changes i.e. staged changes waiting to be
              committed (LocalStagedStatus)
        * None = There are no unstaged or uncommitted changes (LocalDefault)
    * ] (AfterText)

    The (symbols) and surrounding text can be customized by the corresponding
    properties of the global variable $GitPromptSettings.

    For example, a status summary of [master ≡ +0 ~2 -1 | +1 ~1 -0 !]
    corresponds to the following 'git status':

        # On branch master
        #
        # Changes to be committed:
        #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
        #
        #        modified:   this-changed.txt
        #        modified:   this-too.txt
        #        deleted:    gone.ps1
        #
        # Changed but not updated:
        #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
        #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        #
        #        modified:   not-staged.ps1
        #
        # Untracked files:
        #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        #
        #        new.file

USAGE AND CUSTOMIZATION
    You need to import the posh-git module into your PowerShell session to
    use it.  Execute "Import-Module posh-git" to do this. After posh-git has
    been imported, you can execute the command "Add-PoshGitToProfile" to have
    your PowerShell profile updated to import posh-git whenever PowerShell
    starts.

    When posh-git is imported it will provide a basic prompt function that
    displays Git status summary information, unless you have your own, custom
    prompt function. Prompt formatting, among other things, can be customized
    using the global variables: $GitPromptSettings, $GitTabSettings and
    $TortoiseGitSettings. To see the available settings, simply type the
    variable name at the PowerShell prompt (after posh-git has been imported)
    and press Enter.

    For more information on customizing the posh-git default prompt or creating
    your own prompt fuction see:

PERFORMANCE
    Displaying Git status in your prompt for a very large repository can
    be prohibitively slow. Rather than turn off Git status entirely, you can
    disable it on a repo-by-repo basis by adding individual repository paths
    to $GitPromptSettings.RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus.

PRIMARY COMMANDS
    Get-GitStatus:
    Returns information about the current Git repository as
    well as the index and working directory.

    Write-GitStatus:
    Writes directly to host the formatted text, as described above in the
    GIT STATUS PROMPT section, when passed in the repository information
    returned by Get-GitStatus e.g. Write-GitStatus (Get-GitStatus)

    Write-VcsStatus:
    Gets the Git repository information and writes it formatted, as described
    above in the GIT STATUS PROMPT section, directly to the host.
